I currently work as a Research Scientist at Meta AI in the Brain & AI group. Previously, I was a Research Scientist at [InteraXon](https://choosemuse.com/) (maker of the Muse headband).

I completed a PhD in the [Parietal team](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/) at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/saclay), Université Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of [Alexandre Gramfort](http://alexandre.gramfort.net/) and [Denis Engemann](https://denis-engemann.de/). This work was done jointly at [InteraXon](https://choosemuse.com/).

My research focuses on machine learning for the decoding and processing of neuroimaging data.
